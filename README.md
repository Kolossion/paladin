# THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK
I've tried for several days now to get some form of state management
to work properly with this project. I'm storing it to maybe come back when I've figured something out. For now, if you figure out why the application is not re-rendering after the first instance of the 'n' key being pressed (when I know for sure that the state is being updated and the actions are being fired), please let me know or make a PR. Thanks!
